# sketching_optimisation

Examples of random projection sketching methods to reduce the computational
burden of intensive matrix computations.

To do:
1. Refactor and test the solvers for IHS versions of OLS,RIDGE & LASSO
2. Start refactoring the subspace embedding experiments
3. Generate data metadata scripts and plots
